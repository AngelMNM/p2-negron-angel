            <h3 class="h3about">RVTA History</h3>
            <p class="aboutarticleText"> The Round Valley Trout Association is a non-profit organization incorporated in the State of New Jersey. RVTA was founded in September of 1980 for the sole purpose of supplementing the trout stocking program of the New Jersey Division of Fish
                and Wildlife. Additionally, RVTA continues to be an important voice in the overall Management of the reservoir.
                <br> Over the years, RVTA has stocked over 140,000 trout in public waters of Round Valley Reservoir for the benefit and sport of ALL ANGLERS. All of our fund raising activities are conducted for the purpose of supporting our trout stocking
                programs. These activities include; RVTA membership dues, fishing contest entry fees, raffles, sport show presence, and our “Trophy Trout" Program. RVTA partners with the New Jersey Division of Fish & Wildlife in its ongoing effort to
                provide a top quality Fish Management Plan for the reservoir. RVTA supplements the fishery with its own annual trout stocking, as well as its Trophy Trout and Bait Fish Programs. With increased pressure on the fishery, the role that RVTA
                plays in supporting the fishery has become even more important. You can become a part if it by joining.
